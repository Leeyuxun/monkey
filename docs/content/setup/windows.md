1. Follow the steps to complete the installation.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Windows update

The installer requires [Windows update #2999226](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows).
If you're having trouble running the installer, please make sure to install the
update via Windows Update or manually from the link above.

### Supported browsers

The Monkey Island supports Chrome (and Chrome-based) browsers. If your Windows
server only has Internet Explorer installed, please install Chrome or a similar
modern browser. [You can download Google Chrome
here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Upgrading

To upgrade the Infection Monkey on Windows, download the new installer and run
it. The new Monkey version will be installed over the old version.

If you'd like to keep your existing configuration, you can export it to a file
using the *Export config* button and then import it to the new Monkey Island.
